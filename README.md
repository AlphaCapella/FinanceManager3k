# FinanceManager3k

A console application written in C++ to store transactions. This is not a serious project and was created with the intend to learn about databases in C++. 
The library used is SQLite 3, a small but fast implementation of a SQL database. 

There have not been any updates on this project since november of 2020. In the future this project might get some love, but for the time being there
are no plans.
